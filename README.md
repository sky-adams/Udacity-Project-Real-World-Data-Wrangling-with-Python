# Udacity-Project-Real-World-Data-Wrangling-with-Python

## Description

I completed this project as part of Udacity's Data Analyst nanodegree program. The project uses data from the Audobon Society's annual Christmas Bird Count in Santa Barbara, California, as well as historical rainfall data for Santa Barbara. After wrangling the data and merging the datasets, I analyzed it to look at trends in bird populations in Santa Barbara over time and explored whether or not there is a correlation between annual rainfall and the size of bird populations.

## Data
The Christmas Bird Count data is not included in the repository as that would not be in line with the Audobon Society's [Terms of Use](https://www.audubon.org/content/policy-regarding-use-christmas-bird-count-data) for the data. However, it may be downloaded from the Audobon Society's [Christmas Bird Count data website](https://netapp.audubon.org/CBCObservation/Historical/ResultsByCount.aspx#). A detailed description of the data that I downloaded is in the Jupyter Notebook in this repository.

The historical rainfall data is available for download from the County of Santa Barbara's website ([link to file](https://files.countyofsb.org/pwd/hydrology/historic%20data/rainfall/XLS%20Dailys/234dailys.xls)).
